==
An implementation of a Self Organizing Map, also known as a Kohonen map.

    A self-organizing map (SOM) or self-organizing feature map (SOFM) is a type 
	of artificial neural network (ANN) that is trained using unsupervised learning
	to produce a low-dimensional (typically two-dimensional), discretized 
	representation of the input space of the training samples, called a map.

See [article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organizing_map) for more information.

Code Features

Sample

The sample follows the "hello world" of self-organizing maps by producing a color 
pallet where the colors are randomized and then organized via a self-organizing map.

An example of the output looks like the following image:
